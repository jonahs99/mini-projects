2. [Sobel](https://github.com/jonahs99/sobel) - edge detection as a first Golang project
3. [Painter](https://github.com/jonahs99/painter) - trying to copy a generative art project
4. [Fracture](https://github.com/jonahs99/fracture) - copying another generative art project

## Motivation

* Improve self-discipline with focused tasks and goals
* Explore fun ideas without the guilt of "unfinished" projects
* Familiarize myself with different toolchains
* Improve time-management and gauging time constraints

## Goals

* Do one mini-project per week, starting **today**
* Set a basic plan for finishing (what can I manage in 30-60 minutes daily?)
* Make cool things!
