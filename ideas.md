# Ideas for mini-projects

## Generative art

* Mandlebrot set visualizer - use monte carlo for nice antialiasing
* "Differential line" spin off. Initial curve (small loop). Point mass pen steers around trying to keep constant distance but with random "wind" noise and drifting due to intertia. Continue to loop around to get a somewhat knobbly contour map.
* Heart rate app (use camera+flash, detect when finger on camera)
* Art idea- texture of carved wood. Intersection of plane, scoops (spheres/ellipsoids?). Crisp shading
