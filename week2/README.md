# Week 2: First Go Project

Simple implementation of the sobel operator as per this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator).

![An example of the output](example.png)

Usage: `sobel -in <path to input file> -out <path to output file>`

# Plan

I will try to implement the Sobel image detection algorithm in Go. This should be a simple project, but I will be playing around with a new language.

## Tools

* Go
* However graphics is done in Go

## Tasks

- [ ] Get Go running
- [ ] Load and display an image
- [ ] Operate on the image
- [ ] Display and save the output
